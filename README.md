Overall, My code first ask's the user if they want to go with math cauclation like area of shapes or like simple math like additoon, subtraction etc or with the graphs. Depending on whatever the user pick it will go ahead with that. If the user pick's math calclation  then it will ask them to pick again from 1-8 which is basicklly area of triangle, circle, square and rectangle and also addition,subtraction, multiplication and division. Then it will ask them to input the value and then eventaully it will solve it. If they chosoe the graph, Then they will have to pick between trig graph or polynomial graph. If they pick the trig graph, then it will simply aks them if they want a sin, cos or tan graph. Whichever one they pick it will plot it. If they pick the second option, polynomial graph then it will aks them to input the equaion (using x as the variable). Once they input it, then it will aks if they also want a linear line on the same graph, if yes then it will aks them to input a linear equation (y=mx+b) and  finally then it will print it with a point of intersection (if any). if no linear line then it will still print but just with the polynomial equation. 
Overall, the goal of this project is just to make a calcutaor for someone eitehr looking for math calculation or like someone that want's a gaph. This is similar to like desmos an online tool we use or any calculators too that we use.
